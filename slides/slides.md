+ God's **love** for you is **greater** than:
  + any **obstacle** before you
  + any **sin** within you
  + any **ambition** you could have for yourself

For if we are **beside ourselves**, it is for **God**; <br>
if we are in our **right mind**, it is for **you**.

[14](# "ref")
For the **love** of Christ **controls** us,  <br>
because we have concluded this:  <br>
that one has **died** for all,  <br>
therefore all have died;

and he died for all, that those who **live**  <br>
might no longer live for **themselves**  <br>
but for **him** who for their sake  <br>
**died** and was **raised**.

If we are **beside ourselves** <br>
(<i>*ἐξέστημεν*</i>: ecstasy, insanity)

[2 Corinthians 5:13a (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ ancient Gr: **delirium** / insanity
  + to commune with **divinity**
  + e.g., oracle at **Delphi**
+ to **reject** the world's idea of **success**
+ means being a **fool** in their eyes:

---
... those who boast about **outward appearance** <br>
and not about what is in the **heart**.

For the word of the cross is **folly** <br>
to those who are **perishing**, 

but to us who are being **saved** <br>
it is the **power of God**.

[1 Corinthians 1:18 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ (Amy Carmichael)
+ (John Sung)
+ willing to be fools for **God**:
  + doesn't **matter** what others think
  + e.g. friend gives you "A+"
+ so **school** doesn't matter? 

---
If we are in our **right mind**<br>
(<i>*σωφρονοῦμεν*</i>: salvation, sober)

[2 Corinthians 5:13b (ESV)](# "ref")



>>>
+ "right mind": **saved** thinking (salvation)
  + sober, considered
  + why **school**? skills, excellence

# What **holds** you together?

+ for **you**: to serve others
  + equip to **teach**, encourage
+ **controls**: holds together
  + not **compel** (push, motion)
  + keep **disparate**/competing parts 
    + in **integral** whole
  + **fools** for God
    + **wise** to serve others
+ cf Phil 1:23 **hard-pressed**:
  + next life: **Christ**
  + this life: fruitful **labour**
+ even in **play**:
  + **purpose** on the playground
  + not to **grab** best activities for self
  + but to show Christ's **love** to others
