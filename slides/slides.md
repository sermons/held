# What **holds** you together? 

>>>
+ "beside ourselves": **ecstasy**
  + considered a **fool** in eyes of world
  + those who boast acc to **face** not **heart**
  + **cross** is foolishness
+ for **God**:
  + doesn't **matter** what others think
  + e.g. friend gives you "A+"
  + so **school** doesn't matter? 
+ "right mind": **saved** thinking (salvation)
  + sober, considered
  + why **school**? skills, excellence
+ for **you**: to serve others
  + equip to **teach**, encourage
+ **controls**: holds together
  + not **compel** (push, motion)
  + keep **disparate**/competing parts 
    + in **integral** whole
  + **fools** for God
  + **wise** to serve others
+ even in **play**:
  + **purpose** on the playground
  + not to **grab** best activities for self
  + but to show Christ's **love** to others

For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; <br>
if we are in our right mind, it is for you.

For the love of Christ controls us,  <br>
because we have concluded this:  <br>
that one has died for all,  <br>
therefore all have died;

[15](# "ref")
and he died for all, that those who live  <br>
might no longer live for themselves  <br>
but for him who for their sake  <br>
died and was raised.
