+ God's **love** for you is **greater** than:
  + any **obstacle** before you
  + any **sin** within you
  + any **ambition** you could have for yourself

---
[13](# "ref")
For if we are **beside ourselves**, it is for **God**; <br>
if we are in our **right mind**, it is for **you**.

[14](# "ref")
For the **love** of Christ **controls** us,  <br>
because we have concluded this:

[2 Corinthians 5:13-15 (p.1/2) (ESV)](# "ref")

---
that **one** has died for all,  <br>
therefore **all** have died; 

[15](# "ref")
and he **died** for all, that those who live  <br>
might no longer live for **themselves**  <br>
but for **him** who for their sake  <br>
**died** and was **raised**.

[2 Corinthians 5:13-15 (p.2/2) (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ 2 **competing** forces:

---
For the **love** of Christ **compels** us <br>
<i>(*συνέχει*: holds together)</i>

[2 Corinthians 5:14 (NKJV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ not **compel** (push, motion)
+ keep **disparate**/competing parts 
  + in **integral** whole
+ **fools** for God
  + **wise** to serve others
+ cf Phil 1:23 **hard-pressed**:
  + next life: **Christ**
  + this life: fruitful **labour**

---
If we are **beside ourselves**, it is for God <br>
<i>(*ἐξέστημεν*: ecstasy, insanity)</i>

[2 Corinthians 5:13a (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ ancient Gr: **delirium** / insanity
  + to commune with **divinity**
  + e.g., oracle at **Delphi**
+ when we do not **pursue** the same things the world does
  + **reject** the world's idea of **success**
+ they think we are **insane**
  + because they value **image**:

---
... those who boast about **outward appearance** <br>
and not about what is in the **heart**.

[2 Corinthians 5:12 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ world says success means **fame**
  + money, **influence**
  + having people **respect** you
+ willing to be fools for **God**
  + not to **impress** others
  + or even **prove** them wrong

---
+ (Amy Carmichael)
+ (John Sung)

>>>
+ willing to **leave** comfortable life
  + to **serve** those **discarded** by society
+ willing to **throw** away our credentials
  + to preach the **foolishness** of the cross
+ doesn't **matter** what others think
  + e.g. friend gives you "A+"

---
For the word of the cross is **folly** <br>
to those who are **perishing**, 

but to us who are being **saved** <br>
it is the **power of God**.

[1 Corinthians 1:18 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ so **school** doesn't matter? 

---
If we are in our **right mind**, it is for you<br>
<i>(*σωφρονοῦμεν*: salvation, sober)</i>

[2 Corinthians 5:13b (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ "right mind": **saved** thinking (salvation)
  + sober, considered
  + why **school**? skills, excellence
+ for **you**: to serve others
  + equip to **teach**, encourage

---

>>>
+ even in **play**:
  + **purpose** on the playground
  + not to **grab** best activities for self
  + but to show Christ's **love** to others

# What **holds** you together? 

>>>
+ whether we are rejected by the world as **fools**
+ or **sober**-minded, dilligently serving others
+ **love** of Christ **holds** us
